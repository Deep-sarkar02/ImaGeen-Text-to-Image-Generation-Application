Text to Image API
To generate a picture from text, the text to image API is available at #https://clipdrop-api.co/text-to-image/v1.

The request must be an https #POST and its body must be a #multipart/form-data with the following fields:

a required prompt text field describing the desired image, with a max length of a 1000 characters.
In case of success:

the response mime-type will be image/png and the response body will be an image with dimensions of 1024x1024 pixels.

the response headers will include a x-remaining-credits property to tell you how many credits you have left and a x-credits-consumed property to tell you how many credits were consumed by your request.

In case of an error:

the response mime-type is application/json, error type is indicated by the response status code and details are in the json body, ie
{ "error": "No api key provided" }


const form = new FormData()
form.append('prompt', 'shot of vaporwave fashion dog in miami')

fetch('https://clipdrop-api.co/text-to-image/v1', {
method: 'POST',
headers: {
'x-api-key': YOUR_API_KEY,
},
body: form,
})
.then(response => response.arrayBuffer())
.then(buffer => {
// buffer here is a binary representation of the returned image
})
